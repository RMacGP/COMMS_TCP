**THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG**

This file contains mostly simple "printable" characters, but there are some special "control characters" marking the ends of lines.  All the printable characters have values (in decimal) between 32 [space] and 126 [~].  The control characters have values less than 32.

In Notepad++, you can view these control characters.  On the View menu, Show Symbol, and select Show All Characters.

The convention in Windows is to use two characters to mark the end of a line.  These are called CR and LF, with values 13 and 10 respectively.  CR stands for carriage return, and would move the printing position back to the left margin.  LF stands for line feed, and would move the printing position down to the next line.

Unix or Linux systems use only LF to mark line ends.  In C strings, \n represents LF and \r represents CR.  However, in writing strings to files, \n is taken as a line end marker, and is translated into whatever is appropriate for the operating system being used.  Similarly, in reading strings from a file, whatever is used by the operating system to mark the end of a line is translated into \n.
