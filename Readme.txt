These are source file for the Internet & TCP assigment in Communication Systems.
These versions should work on Linux and Mac.
See the assignment instructions on Brightspace for details.

The fileStore folder contains two example files - it is used by the file handling demonstration program.

If you are working in a Linux terminal (command prompt), use the makefile:
make C will build the client program;
make S will build the server program;
make A will build the address lookup program;
make F will build the file handling program;
make D will build the string handling program;
make clean will delete all the files that make has created, leaving only the source files;
make on its own will build the first three of the programs above.

The executable files have names ending in .exe.
To run one from a terminal, use ./filename.exe - for example, ./client.exe

To run another program at the same time, open another terminal.
